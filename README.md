A Contextual Bot enabled Intelligent solution, which would be checking the release user stories, notes, design documents and continuously update the Knowledge portal with summarized information by customer Journeys - What, where and How systems are impacted with new release changes - Rule based learning and reinforcement learning. Contextual keywords to enable the searchs of the user on the portal. System should be able to find the documents with cognitive interfaces to user. The knowledge should cover technical details and API contracts and where and what APIs impacted at code level for this particular business need.

Creating an intelligent solution like the one you described involves several advanced steps and integrates various technologies, including NLP (Natural Language Processing), machine learning, and web development. Below is a high-level design of such a system:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
The first step is to collect user stories, notes, and design documents. These documents can be stored in a document database (such as MongoDB). You would use NLP techniques to preprocess data, including tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stop words, to make it more suitable for analysis.

2. Information Extraction
Using rule-based NLP and machine learning techniques (for example, Named Entity Recognition models), you can extract relevant entities and relationships from the documents. This step would involve identifying customer journeys, technical details, and API contracts. You can use libraries like SpaCy or NLTK in Python for NLP tasks.

3. Knowledge Base Construction
The extracted information is structured and stored in a knowledge base. This could be implemented using a graph database like Neo4j, which can effectively model relationships between entities (e.g., which APIs are impacted by a certain release).

4. Information Summarization and Update
To summarize and continuously update the knowledge portal, implement a combination of rule-based algorithms and reinforcement learning. The rule-based component could handle straightforward summarization tasks based on pre-defined templates, while reinforcement learning could optimize information presentation based on user feedback and interactions.

5. Cognitive Search Interface
For the search interface, integrate an NLP model capable of understanding contextual keywords and queries. Elasticsearch, combined with its NLP plugins, can provide powerful full-text search capabilities that understand the semantic meaning behind queries.

6. Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Improvement
Use reinforcement learning to track user interactions with the knowledge portal. By analyzing which documents are most helpful or integrating direct user feedback, the system can learn to improve the relevance of the information presented. You can explore reinforcement learning libraries like TensorFlow Agents or PyTorch.

Integration and Deployment
Integrate the various components (data preprocessing, information extraction, knowledge base construction, and search interface) into a web application. Flask or Django can be suitable for developing the backend in Python, while React or Angular can be used for the frontend. Deploy the application on a cloud platform like AWS or Azure for scalability and reliability.

Given the complexity and broad scope of your requirement, this overview provides a starting point. Each step involves detailed design and implementation decisions based on specific project needs and constraints.
